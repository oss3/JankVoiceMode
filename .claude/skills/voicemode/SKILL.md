name: voicemode
description: Voice interaction for Claude Code. Use when users mention voice mode, speak, talk, converse, voice status, or voice troubleshooting.
---

## First-Time Setup

If VoiceMode isn't working or MCP fails to connect, run:

```
/voicemode:install
```

After install, reconnect MCP: `/mcp` → select voicemode → "Reconnect" (or restart Claude Code).

---

# VoiceMode

Natural voice conversations with Claude Code using speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS).

**Note:** The Python package is `voice-mode` (hyphen), but the CLI command is `voicemode` (no hyphen).

## When to Use MCP vs CLI

| Task | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Voice conversations | MCP `voicemode:converse` | Faster - server already running |
| Service start/stop | MCP `voicemode:service` | Works within Claude Code |
| Installation | CLI `voice-mode-install` | One-time setup |
| Configuration | CLI `voicemode config` | Edit settings directly |
| Diagnostics | CLI `voicemode diag` | Administrative tasks |

## Usage

Use the `converse` MCP tool to speak to users and hear their responses:

```python
# Speak and listen for response (most common usage)
voicemode:converse("Hello! What would you like to work on?")

# Speak without waiting (for narration while working)
voicemode:converse("Searching the codebase now...", wait_for_response=False)
```

For most conversations, just pass your message - defaults handle everything else.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `message` | required | Text to speak |
| `wait_for_response` | true | Listen after speaking |
| `voice` | auto | TTS voice |

For all parameters, see [Converse Parameters](../../docs/reference/converse-parameters.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Narrate without waiting** - Use `wait_for_response=False` when announcing actions
2. **One question at a time** - Don't bundle multiple questions in voice mode
3. **Check status first** - Verify services are running before starting conversations
4. **Let VoiceMode auto-select** - Don't hardcode providers unless user has preference
5. **First run is slow** - Model downloads happen on first start (2-5 min), then instant

## Handling Pauses and Wait Requests

When the user asks you to wait or give them time:

**Short pauses (up to 60 seconds):** If the user says something ending with "wait" (e.g., "hang on", "give me a sec", "wait"), VoiceMode automatically pauses for 60 seconds then resumes listening. This is built-in.

**Longer pauses (2+ minutes):** Use `bash sleep N` where N is seconds. For example, if the user says "give me 5 minutes":
```bash
sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes
```
Then call converse again when the wait is over:
```python
voicemode:converse("Five minutes is up. Ready when you are.")
```

**Configuration:** The short pause duration is configurable via `VOICEMODE_WAIT_DURATION` (default: 60 seconds).

## Check Status

```bash
voicemode service status          # All services
voicemode service status whisper  # Specific service
```

Shows service status including running state, ports, and health.

## Installation

```bash
# Install VoiceMode CLI and configure services
uvx voice-mode-install --yes

# Install local services (Apple Silicon recommended)
voicemode service install whisper
```

See [Getting Started](../../docs/tutorials/getting-started.md) for detailed steps.

## Service Management

```python
# Start/stop services
voicemode:service("whisper", "start")

# View logs for troubleshooting
voicemode:service("whisper", "logs", lines=50)
```

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| whisper | 2022 | Speech-to-text |
| voicemode | 8765 | HTTP/SSE server |

**Actions:** status, start, stop, restart, logs, enable, disable

## Configuration

```bash
voicemode config list                           # Show all settings
voicemode config set VOICEMODE_TTS_VOICE nova   # Set default voice
voicemode config edit                           # Edit config file
```

Config file: `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`

See [Configuration Guide](../../docs/guides/configuration.md) for all options.

## DJ Mode

Background music during VoiceMode sessions with track-level control.

```bash
# Core playback
voicemode dj play /path/to/music.mp3  # Play a file or URL
voicemode dj status                    # What's playing
voicemode dj pause                     # Pause playback
voicemode dj resume                    # Resume playback
voicemode dj stop                      # Stop playback

# Navigation and volume
voicemode dj next                      # Skip to next chapter
voicemode dj prev                      # Go to previous chapter
voicemode dj volume 30                 # Set volume to 30%

# Music For Programming
voicemode dj mfp list                  # List available episodes
voicemode dj mfp play 49               # Play episode 49
voicemode dj mfp sync                  # Convert CUE files to chapters

# Music library
voicemode dj find "daft punk"          # Search library
voicemode dj library scan              # Index ~/Audio/music
voicemode dj library stats             # Show library info

# Play history and favorites
voicemode dj history                   # Show recent plays
voicemode dj favorite                  # Toggle favorite on current track
```

**Configuration:** Set `VOICEMODE_DJ_VOLUME` in `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env` to customize startup volume (default: 50%).

## Voice Handoff Between Agents

Transfer voice conversations between Claude Code agents for multi-agent workflows.

**Use cases:**
- Personal assistant routing to project-specific foremen
- Foremen delegating to workers for focused tasks
- Returning control when work is complete

### Quick Reference

```python
# 1. Announce the transfer
voicemode:converse("Transferring you to a project agent.", wait_for_response=False)

# 2. Spawn with voice instructions (mechanism depends on your setup)
spawn_agent(path="/path", prompt="Load voicemode skill, use converse to greet user")

# 3. Go quiet - let new agent take over
```

**Hand-back:**
```python
voicemode:converse("Transferring you back to the assistant.", wait_for_response=False)
# Stop conversing, exit or go idle
```

### Key Principles

1. **Announce transfers**: Always tell the user before transferring
2. **One speaker**: Only one agent should use converse at a time
3. **Distinct voices**: Different voices make handoffs audible
4. **Provide context**: Tell receiving agent why user is being transferred
